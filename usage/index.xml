Enrichment Functions You can modify statemachine/enrich.asl.json to change which enrichment functions run. The easiest way to do this is to use the included helper script, which provides a nice wizard to select functions.
make setup Then run the deploy again to save your changes to AWS.
Don&amp;rsquo;t have CrowdStrike? No problem, just remove that function! If you want, you can also remove unnecessary functions from template.</description></item><item><title>Getting started</title><link>https://gyrospectre.github.io/squyre/usage/getting_started/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Feb 2022 14:16:07 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://gyrospectre.github.io/squyre/usage/getting_started/</guid><description>There are a couple of ways you can deploy, either directly between your alert source and ticketing system (pattern 1), or using an incident management platform like Opsgenie (pattern 2).
Pattern 1 is the out of the box configuration as it&amp;rsquo;s the most generic. If you don&amp;rsquo;t already have something in place to create tickets automatically when alerts fire, then this is for you. We currently support Splunk and Sumo Logic for alert sources.</description></item><item><title>Getting Started: Jira Setup</title><link>https://gyrospectre.github.io/squyre/usage/jira/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Feb 2022 14:16:07 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://gyrospectre.github.io/squyre/usage/jira/</guid><description> Create a Jira API key.

You must have an AWS account to host it. It runs solely in AWS using serverless services (lambdas and step functions). If you don&amp;rsquo;t have one, don&amp;rsquo;t be too concerned with signing up - if you&amp;rsquo;re only running a few test alerts through Squyre AWS &amp;ldquo;Free Tier&amp;rdquo; should mean the cost is negligible (if not completely free).
You need something that is generating security alerts for you.</description></item></channel></rss>
