For more information, check out https://metrics.torproject.org/exonerator.html. If an alert sourced from a Tor exit node (relay), this can be an interesting piece of information when triaging.
No API key is required.

Example Result ExoneraTor believes 127.0.0.1 was recently a Tor relay.

For example; if an alert fires for suspicious activity and we&amp;rsquo;re not able to get additional information from Greynoise, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop the analyst from getting on with things, it&amp;rsquo;s just that some manual work might be needed to do what Squyre would otherwise had done!</description></item><item><title>Architecture</title><link>https://gyrospectre.github.io/squyre/architecture/architecture/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Feb 2022 14:16:07 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://gyrospectre.github.io/squyre/architecture/architecture/</guid><description>Squyre is serverless, and uses AWS services SNS, API Gateway, Lambda and Step Functions to do it&amp;rsquo;s thing.
Alerts are sent in via SNS or Webhook, which triggers the first Lambda function, conductor. This function takes the alert body, extracts IP addresses, domain names, URLs and hostnames, and then starts the step function with this information. Note that any Microsoft 365 ATP Safe Links are also converted into their original URLs at this stage.</description></item><item><title>Customising for your environment</title><link>https://gyrospectre.github.io/squyre/usage/customise/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Feb 2022 14:16:07 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://gyrospectre.github.io/squyre/usage/customise/</guid><description>There are a couple of features which can be customised for your environment.
Enrichment Functions You can modify statemachine/enrich.asl.json to change which enrichment functions run. The easiest way to do this is to use the included helper script, which provides a nice wizard to select functions.

Don&amp;rsquo;t have CrowdStrike? No problem, just remove that function! If you want, you can also remove unnecessary functions from template.</description></item><item><title>Getting started</title><link>https://gyrospectre.github.io/squyre/usage/getting_started/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Feb 2022 14:16:07 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://gyrospectre.github.io/squyre/usage/getting_started/</guid><description>There are a couple of ways you can deploy, either directly between your alert source and ticketing system (pattern 1), or using an incident management platform like Opsgenie (pattern 2).
Pattern 1 is the out of the box configuration as it&amp;rsquo;s the most generic. If you don&amp;rsquo;t already have something in place to create tickets automatically when alerts fire, then this is for you. We currently support Splunk and Sumo Logic for alert sources.</description></item><item><title>Getting Started: Jira Setup</title><link>https://gyrospectre.github.io/squyre/usage/jira/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Feb 2022 14:16:07 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://gyrospectre.github.io/squyre/usage/jira/</guid><description> Create a Jira API key.

You must have an AWS account to host it. It runs solely in AWS using serverless services (lambdas and step functions). If you don&amp;rsquo;t have one, don&amp;rsquo;t be too concerned with signing up - if you&amp;rsquo;re only running a few test alerts through Squyre AWS &amp;ldquo;Free Tier&amp;rdquo; should mean the cost is negligible (if not completely free).
You need something that is generating security alerts for you.</description></item><item><title>State Machine</title><link>https://gyrospectre.github.io/squyre/architecture/state/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Feb 2022 14:16:07 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://gyrospectre.github.io/squyre/architecture/state/</guid><description>The main state machine is called EnrichStateMachine, because it, uh enriches, and it&amp;rsquo;s a state machine.
It is defined by statemachine/enrich.asl.json in the AWS ASL language.
Layout is straightforward; nested parallel branches run the enrichment tasks which are sent to the output function at the end to update alerts/tickets.</description></item><item><title>Alienvault OTX</title><link>https://gyrospectre.github.io/squyre/functions/alienvaultotx/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Feb 2022 14:05:25 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://gyrospectre.github.io/squyre/functions/alienvaultotx/</guid><description>Summary Indicator context from the Alienvault OTX threat intelligence community.
